# Unified Relativity Visualization

This project visualizes a grid and various space objects using PyQt5 and OpenGL.

## Requirements

The code relies on several Python packages:

- `PyQt5`
- `PyOpenGL`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

After installing the dependencies, you can run the demo via:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a window showing the grid visualizer.
